Of use to nobody but me, this repo is an analysis of my sketchbook
"spreadsheet" (Org Mode file) which shows number of pages[1] completed
per month. Example output is shown above.

I have a few hundred sketchbooks (so far). In each sketchbook, I
typically jot down the time and place where the sketchbook was started
and finished.  Sometimes I forget and I have to fill in =?='s in the
spreadsheet for the year, month or day portion (based on other
available clues).  Given these dates, if I assume uniform rate of
drawing in any given sketchbook, since I know how many pages are in
each sketchbook, I can determine roughly what my monthly output has
been.

I haven't entered all the sketchbooks yet, but when I have finished,
I'll have that graph going from the 1980s up until, say, I die.

The workflow is:
- Draw draw draw;
- Enter sketchbooks in Org Mode spreadsheet (not included here);
- Export to CSV;
- Use the Clojure code (=boot= task) in this repo to generate the graph;
- Contemplate on one's productivity, or lack thereof.

In case you were wondering: yes, this is all a bit over the top. There
are probably several things goofy about it from a technical, artistic
and karmic perspective.
